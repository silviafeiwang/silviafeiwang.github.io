<!-- **Singing<i class="em em-microphone" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="MICROPHONE"></i> and listening to music<i class="em em-musical_note" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="MUSICAL NOTE"></i>**
- Singing and listening to music are my main hobbies to do. Every time I feel depressed, music never fails to bring me into a bright, seemingly weightless world. I enjoy posting my cover songs [here][kg], where I've got 100+ followers! I also learn to play ukulele in my free time, but I'm still a rookie.   -->

<!-- - I love dogs and cats! They are so cute that even just stroking them can get my mind off things. The bad thing is that I can't make the time to take good care of a pet owned by me! -->

<!-- - Recently I fall in love with cooking. To me, it's a way of relaxation and creativity. I can empty my mind as I focus on cutting carrots into same size of cubes, or sing along to my farorite oldies while peeling potatoes. I get excited when I try a fresh recipe or experiment with ingredients. But most importantly, self-made food helps me control calories intake to lose weight<i class="em em-clap" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="CLAPPING HANDS SIGN"></i>. -->
