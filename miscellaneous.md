- I go to the gym <i class="em em-muscle" aria-role="presentation" aria-label=""></i> regularly to stay fit and have fun. Working out is not just a hobby but a lifestyle to me. I also like playing badminton but it's hard to find a badminton partner here.
  - Recent goals: pull-ups


- I love **dogs <i class="em em-dog" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="DOG FACE"></i> and cats <i class="em em-cat" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="CAT FACE"></i>**! They are so cute that even just stroking them makes me relaxed and happy. I have a boy cat named _Mantou_ (white steamed bun), who is obsessed with playing fetch like a dog.
