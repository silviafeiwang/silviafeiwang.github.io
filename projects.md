## **Refining Congestion Control Using Deep Reinforcement Learning**
<div align="right">
<p>Undergraduate Research<br>
Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Toronto<br>
Sept 2019 - Nov 2019 & Feb 2019 - June 2020</p>
</div>

**Advised by Prof. Baochun Li and Dr. Salma Emara**

- Refined the expert control policy migrated from our target congestion control protocol in terms of code
- Redesigned the switching mechanism between the expert and the agent control policy, and enhanced the agent's learnability
- Built an RL congestion control environment with an asynchronous RL framework where the agent execution does not block the network sender
- Designed an online training scheme to speed up the convergence of the agent's behaviors and improve its generalizability in new network environment
